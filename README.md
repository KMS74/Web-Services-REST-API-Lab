# REST APIs Design Lab

## We have Two Resources:

- Posts - CRUD operations on posts
- Comments - CRUD operations on comments

- Use versions for your REST API
- Handle partial update on posts
- Handle update by replace whole document on comments
- Handle fetching comments that belongs to a specific post (use separate endpoint to fetch that post's comments)
